Accordingly, you further expressly agree that you will with due care, make your own study and evaluation of each investment decision or security, and of each issuer and guarantor of, and each provider of credit support for, each security or credit that you may consider purchasing, holding, selling, or providing. For the avoidance of doubt, Moody’s Materials and opinions may also include quantitative model-based estimates of credit risk and related opinions or commentary published by Moody’s Analytics, Inc.
